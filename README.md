# Build a Graphing Calculator
You will be working on this project with Google Colaboratory.

After going to that link, create a copy of the notebook either in your own account or locally. Once you complete the project and it passes the test (included at that link), submit your project link below. If you are submitting a Google Colaboratory link, make sure to turn on link sharing for "anyone with the link."

For this challenge, you need to create a graphing calculator using Python that can take input and do the following:

- Graph one or more functions
- Create a table of (x,y) values
- Shade above or below the line
- Solve and graph a system of equations
- Zoom in or out on a graph
- Solve quadratic equations
If you are struggling, you can follow the video walkthrough for this project.

Once you're done, submit the URL to the public Colab notebook on your Google drive.
